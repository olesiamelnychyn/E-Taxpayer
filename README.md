There is no more long queues and doubtful sums. It provides you a possibility to see all you taxes as a list, which is constructed especially for each natural person, natural person-entrepreneur and juridical person.

The main functions, which help you not to lost in your calculation, are: all payments are listed and you can also see if there is any over-/underpayment on every tax.

Also there may be a list with your payments in date order and a total sum paid to the country.

«E-Taxpayer» is an application which puts in order all your spendings as a ratepayer.
